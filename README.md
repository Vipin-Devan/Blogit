Information

This repository contains a full-stack blog application with two sub-folders: client and server. Inside each of them, run npm install to install the required dependencies.
You can use the commands npm run server from the server folder to start up the backend and npm start from the client to run the code. Both the client and the server need to be running for the application to work.
